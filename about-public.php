        <div class="row">
            <p style="text-align:justify;">A long time ago, Barangay Ambiong was part of a vast expanse of land within La Trinidad, without a formal name. It wasn't until settlers from Kabayan, Bokod, Amburayan, Ampusongan, and Kibungan in Benguet arrived that the area began to form its identity. Most of these settlers were Ibalois and Kankanaeys. The name "Ambiong" is derived from the Ibaloi word "Ambiongan," which means "black carpet bees"â€”a reference to the bees that thrived in the area's lush hills and dense forests. These bees would often burrow into dead tree trunks to create their shelters. Up until the 1960s, Ambiong remained a rich landscape teeming with flora and fauna, mainly serving as a place for hunting and food gathering. Originally part of Barangay Eastern Pico, Ambiong became a separate barangay in 1948 through Presidential Decree No. 3590 and P.D. No. 557.
            <br>
            <br>
Today, Barangay Ambiong plays a vital role as a watershed area for both La Trinidad and Baguio City, with forests still covering about 50% of its land. In addition, the barangay is becoming well-known for the production of chrysanthemum cut flowers. Balancing environmental preservation with agricultural and economic growth remains a key challenge for planners and leaders. This socio-economic and physical profile has been created to provide essential baseline information about Barangay Ambiong, assessing its people's needs in areas such as livelihood, health, sanitation, peace and order, education, housing, utilities, and civic participation. It aims to guide decision-makers at all levels in crafting programs and initiatives for the sustainable development of the barangay.
